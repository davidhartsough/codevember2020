# Codevember 2020

**Do something cool, neat, and rad with code.**

**Do it during November 2020.**

Turn this into your own dope website.

## Steps

1. [Download this template website as a .zip](https://github.com/davidhartsough/codevember2020/archive/main.zip) (but don't do this from your phone)
1. Unpack/extract the project from the .zip file.
1. Find the `index.html` file in the extracted folder, and double-click it to open it in your browser. The URL should look something like this in the tab's address bar: `File: /Users/steve/Downloads/codevember/index.html`. Lookin' good, right?!
1. Download a text editor (AKA an IDE or Integrated Development Environment), assuming you don't already have one. Popular ones include: [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Atom](https://atom.io/). They're all great; any of them will do. Pick your favorite.
1. Open the entire folder (codevember2020) in your text editor.
1. Look at the `index.html` file's code, and replace "Codevember 2020" on line 60 with your name. Ex: `<h1>Heat Wave Dave</h1>`.
1. Go back to your browser tab that has the index.html file open and refresh the page. You should see your name on the website now.
1. Congratulations! You've just started coding! Keep changing things and seeing what happens.
1. Think of something cool to build. Start googling how to do it in HTML, CSS, and JS. (Googling how to do stuff is 90% of what most web developers do on a regular basis. You're virtually a web dev now.)
1. Finally, once you've built your dope website, you're gonna wanna put it on the internet and share it with me and the rest of the world (wide web). So head on over to this cool website at https://app.netlify.com/drop â€” follow the instructions there and simply drag your entire folder (codevember2020) and drop it on the site. Once it's uploaded, share that URL with everybody! Especially me! (You can sign up for a Netlify account to keep the website alive and change the URL to something more reasonable than the randomly generated one you're given.)

### Extra steps

If you check out the code, you'll notice a lot of stuff that looks like `__THIS__`. Anything you see in that format is intended to be replaced. Do a "find and replace" with your text editor and change out the following things in each file:

#### `index.html`

| what to change    | example                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `__TITLE__`       | "My Portfolio"                        |
| `__DESCRIPTION__` | "The portfolio of George Washington." |
| `__KEYWORDS__`    | "portfolio, george, washington"       |
| `__AUTHOR__`      | "George Washington"                   |
| `example.com`     | georgewashington.com                  |
| `#1d201f`         | `#42A5F5`                             |

#### `site.webmanifest`

| what to change  | example           |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| `__TITLE__`     | George Washington |
| `__SHORTNAME__` | George            |
| `#000000`       | `#f8f8f8`         |
| `#000000`       | `#42A5F5`         |

#### `browserconfig.xml`

Change the tile color from `#1d201f` to your theme color (ex: `#42A5F5`).

#### Images

There are a lot of images in this folder that you'll want to replace with your own. Make sure you replace each with an image of the corresponding size and type. I used the [real favicon generator](http://realfavicongenerator.net/) to create most these images, and it's the easiest way for you to do the same!

#### Bonus stuff

You can either delete `index.js` and `sound.mp3` or play around with them. <br /> Get funky!
